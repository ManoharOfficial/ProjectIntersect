Generate Strong, Secure and Unique Passwords

The password generator uses the secure bcrypt algorithm to create strong passwords that are also unique for every site. You just have to remember a single passphrase (master password) and the tool will create different passwords for all your online accounts with a click.
I need to change my password every month?

Some sites requires you to change passwords every month. In that case, just append the month name to the passphrase and have unique passwords every month.
Make it Portable with Dropbox

You can save the password generator code and run on a USB key. Or upload the file to Dropbox and access the tool from all your other computers.
Are my passwords safe?

The passwords are generated inside your web browser itself. None of your data is shared or uploaded and you can even use the tool in offline mode.
